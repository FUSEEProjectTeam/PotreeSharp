# PotreeSharp

This is a sample project how to handle [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree) files in C#. So far this is just decoding position, classification and color for the default encoding.

The [sample pointcloud](https://fuseeprojectteam.github.io/PotreeSharp/AxisCloud/) incuded has four points with descret coordinates and color values.

A much more up-to-date version of this can be found in our main repository: https://github.com/FUSEEProjectTeam/Fusee/tree/master/src/PointCloud/Potree
